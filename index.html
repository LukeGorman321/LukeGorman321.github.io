				<h3>Distortion Visual Effects</h3>
				<p> One of the things I implemented in Echo was the visual effects, including that of the enemies.
				<br><br>I had a clear idea of what I wanted, and I tried several methods to achieve that.
				<br><br>The first thing I tried was creating a second layer of the level and having the enemies be a viewport into that layer, just offset a bit. Unfortunately, this required us to have to duplicates of the map, would not work on objects that may move, and I didn't have as much control as I would want.
				<br><br>I then did some research on shaders, and after a few iterations I was able to create an effect I was happy with. I used a noise generator and scrolled around in the noise to warp the background around the distortion. Then, I made the distortion more transparent the further from the center it was to create a circle with no hard boundary.</p>

				<h3>Fire Spread</h3>
				<p> The feature I implemented which is displayed here is the fire's ability to spread faster onto wooden objects. This is from a game I made for a game jam in Unity with C#. 
				<br><br>This allows the player to control the spread of the fire by moving wooden crates and barrels where they want the fire to spread
				<br><br>One difficulty in creating this was that due to the random nature of the fire's spread, it was not always clear if an adjustment to the code helped make the fire spread in the intended manner. So, I put the settings very high to make the fire spread comically quickly onto wooden things, that way I could clearly see and easily test the algorithm.</p>

				<h3>Candy Cane Catapult</h3>
				<p>One minigame I made in Minecraft using datapacks had a very large map, which was intended to make the game slightly slow, forcing players to manage their resources carefully. <br><br>
				However, this created a problem, since the game ended up going much slower than intended. So, I decided to create a catapult to launch players to the center of the map. <br><br>
				After trying multiple methods of launching the player and fine-tuning the strength of the launch vector, I eventually was able to get it to land where I wanted it.</p>

				<h3>Networking</h3>
				<p>One game I created in Godot involves people on several devices connecting over the internet. I used GDScript and the built in multiplayer capabilities in Godot.<br><br>
				Since I had never done something like this before, I first created a simple counter where whenever one person clicks the increment button, the number goes up on both screens <br><br>
				There were several challenges with this, but by doing this simple task, I learned how to navigate networking for the rest of the project. <br><br>
				For example, one challenge was that the information was all stored on the host's device, so whenever the client tried to increment the number, it would just get overridden by the host's value.<br><br>
				So, rather than just storing a single variable where the total increment is stored, I also stored information to say when a particular person was pressing the button, which was sent in by each player. Then, the host device would collect this data, and increment the count accordingly.</p>
